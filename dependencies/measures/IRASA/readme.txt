Wen H. and Liu Z. (2015) Separating Fractal and Oscillatory Components in the Power Spectrum of Neurophysiological Signals

File list:
Example.m - Give an example for synthesis data, and an example for ECoG data
Four function files: amri_sig_fractal(), amri_sig_genfrac(), amri_sig_plawfit(), amri_sig_filtfft().
ECoG_data.mat: a vector (5-min time series of sampling rate 1kHz recorded from one sensor in the occipital area of macaque brain).
