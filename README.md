Dynameas is a toolbox for calculating measures of neural dynamics on EEG/MEG/(fMRI) data. It runs in MATLAB.

Getting started: Dynameas requires Fieldtrip (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) and EEGLAB (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) to work. Once you've installed Fieldtrip and EEGLAB and familiarized yourself with them a bit, you can check out the tutorial for the toolbox to learn how it works. The file dynameas_tutorial_basic.m or .mlx will walk you through use of the toolbox functions (use the .mlx file if you have MATLAB 2016a or newer).
